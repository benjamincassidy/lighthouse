# Introduction to Lighthouse

> "It was done; it was finished. Yes, she thought, laying down her brush in extreme fatigue, I have had my vision."
> — Virginia Woolf, *To the Lighthouse*

Lighthouse is an Obsidian plugin designed for writers working on long-form projects. Whether you're writing a novel, thesis, technical documentation, or blog series, Lighthouse helps you manage complex writing projects without leaving Obsidian.

## The Problem

When working on long-form writing in Obsidian, you often need to:

- Track word counts across multiple files and folders
- Distinguish between actual writing and research/reference material
- Manage multiple independent projects in the same vault
- Monitor progress toward writing goals
- Stay focused without getting overwhelmed by your entire vault

While Obsidian excels at note-taking and knowledge management, it lacks purpose-built tools for managing writing projects.

## The Solution

Lighthouse brings professional writing project management to Obsidian:

- **Projects as first-class citizens:** Each project has its own configuration, goals, and tracking
- **Smart folder designation:** Separate "content" (what you're writing) from "source" (research and references)
- **Hierarchical word counting:** Track progress at file, folder, and project levels in real-time
- **Writing stats:** Monitor session and daily progress without breaking your flow
- **Dashboard insights:** See project statistics and manage projects from a central view

## Inspiration

Lighthouse is inspired by [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app/), a beloved dedicated writing app for macOS and iOS. Ulysses pioneered the concept of organizing writing into projects with content and source materials. Lighthouse brings this philosophy to Obsidian while preserving Obsidian's flexibility and keeping your files in standard markdown format.

## Philosophy

### Your Data, Your Way

- **No vendor lock-in:** Projects are just folders, files are just markdown
- **Standard formats:** Everything stays in your vault as plain text
- **Non-invasive:** Lighthouse doesn't modify your files or folder structure
- **Portable:** Move files around freely; projects adapt

### Flexibility First

- **No rigid structure:** Organize folders however you want
- **Multiple projects:** Run several independent projects in one vault
- **Compatible:** Works alongside other Obsidian plugins
- **Extensible:** Built with future integrations in mind (Dataview, Templater, etc.)
