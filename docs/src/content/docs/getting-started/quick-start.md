# Quick Start Guide

This guide will walk you through creating your first Lighthouse project and understanding the core workflow.

## Step 1: Create Your First Project

1. Open the **Command Palette** (Cmd/Ctrl+P)
2. Type "Lighthouse" and select **Lighthouse: Create Project**
3. Enter a name for your project (e.g., "My Novel")
4. Select a root folder for your project (or create a new one)

Your project is now created!

## Step 2: Designate Folders

Now you need to tell Lighthouse which folders contain your writing (content) vs research (source).

### Content Folders
These folders count toward your word count goal. Typical content folders:
- `chapters/` - Your actual writing
- `drafts/` - Work in progress
- `scenes/` - Individual scenes or sections

### Source Folders
These folders don't count toward your goal. Typical source folders:
- `research/` - Reference materials
- `notes/` - Planning and brainstorming
- `references/` - Quotes, citations, background info

### Setting Up Folders

1. Open **Settings → Lighthouse**
2. Under your project, you'll see **Content Folders** and **Source Folders**
3. Click **Add Folder** to designate each folder type
4. Select folders from your project's root path

**Tip:** You can change these designations anytime!

## Step 3: Open the Stats Panel

The Stats Panel shows your real-time progress:

1. Click the **Lighthouse icon** in the left ribbon (sidebar), or
2. Use Command Palette: **Lighthouse: Toggle Stats Panel**

The panel shows:
- **Current File:** Word count of the active document
- **Current Folder:** Total words in the folder
- **Project Total:** Your project's complete word count
- **Session:** Words written this session
- **Today:** Words written today

## Step 4: Set a Goal (Optional)

1. Go to **Settings → Lighthouse**
2. Find your project
3. Click **Edit**
4. Set a **Word Count Goal**
5. Save

Now the Stats Panel will show progress toward your goal with a visual indicator!

## Step 5: Start Writing!

That's it! Open any file in your project and start writing. Lighthouse will:

- Track your word count in real-time
- Update file, folder, and project totals automatically
- Monitor your daily and session progress
- Show progress toward your goal

## Understanding the Dashboard

For a broader view of your project:

1. Open Command Palette (Cmd/Ctrl+P)
2. Run **Lighthouse: Open Dashboard**

The dashboard shows:
- Project statistics (total words, files, folders)
- Progress visualization
- Quick actions (create, edit, delete projects)
- Project switching

## Tips for Success

### Organize First, Write Second
Set up your folder structure and designate content vs source folders before diving into writing. This ensures accurate word counts from the start.

### Use Multiple Projects
Don't try to fit everything into one project. Create separate projects for:
- Different books or manuscripts
- Blog series vs standalone posts
- Academic papers vs creative writing

### Check Your Progress Daily
The "Today" counter resets at midnight, giving you a clear view of daily productivity.

### Don't Obsess Over Numbers
Word counts are useful, but they're just one metric. Focus on quality writing, not just quantity.
