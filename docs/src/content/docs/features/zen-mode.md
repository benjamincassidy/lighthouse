# Zen Mode

Zen Mode provides a truly distraction-free writing experience by hiding all UI elements except your writing.

## What Zen Mode Hides

When you enable Zen Mode, Lighthouse hides:

- **Sidebars:** Both left and right sidebars collapse
- **Ribbon:** The left icon bar disappears
- **Status Bar:** Bottom status bar is hidden
- **Tabs:** Tab headers become invisible (but reappear on hover)
- **Navigation:** Breadcrumbs and back/forward arrows hide
- **Sidebar Toggles:** Sidebar toggle buttons disappear

## Using Zen Mode

### Toggle Zen Mode

**Via Command Palette:**
1. Press Cmd/Ctrl+P
2. Run `Lighthouse: Toggle Zen Mode`
3. Your workspace transforms into a clean writing space

**Via Keyboard Shortcut (Optional):**
You can assign a hotkey in Settings → Hotkeys → Lighthouse: Toggle Zen Mode

### Exiting Zen Mode

Simply toggle Zen Mode again using the same command. All UI elements return to their previous state.

## Features

### Invisible Tabs with Hover

Tabs are hidden (0% opacity) but become visible when you hover over the tab bar. This lets you switch between files when needed without visual distraction.

### State Preservation

Zen Mode remembers which sidebars were open before enabling, and restores only those when you exit. If your right sidebar was already closed, it won't suddenly open when you exit Zen Mode.

## Tips

- **Focus on writing:** Use Zen Mode when you need to eliminate all distractions and just write
- **Quick access:** Set a keyboard shortcut for instant toggling
- **Combine with fullscreen:** Use Obsidian's fullscreen mode (View → Toggle Fullscreen) along with Zen Mode for maximum focus
- **Keep Stats Panel visible:** If you want to see your word count while writing, open the Stats Panel before enabling Zen Mode—it will remain visible

## Compatibility

Zen Mode works alongside other focus/zen plugins. If you're using another plugin that modifies the UI, the effects will stack. Toggle Lighthouse's Zen Mode off if you want to use a different plugin's focus mode.
