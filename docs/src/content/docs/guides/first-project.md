# Creating Your First Project

This guide walks you through creating and configuring your first Lighthouse project from scratch.

## Before You Begin

Make sure you have:
- Lighthouse installed and enabled
- A folder structure in mind for your project
- An idea of which folders are content vs source

## Step 1: Organize Your Folders

Before creating the project in Lighthouse, set up your folder structure:

```
My Novel/
├── chapters/
├── drafts/
├── research/
└── notes/
```

This isn't required, but it helps you configure the project correctly from the start.

## Step 2: Create the Project

1. Open Command Palette (Cmd/Ctrl+P)
2. Run **Lighthouse: Create Project**
3. Enter project details:
   - **Name:** "My Novel"
   - **Root Path:** Select "My Novel" folder
   - Leave folders blank for now (we'll add them next)
4. Click **Create**

## Step 3: Designate Folders

1. Go to **Settings → Lighthouse**
2. Find "My Novel" project
3. Click **Edit**
4. Add **Content Folders:** chapters/, drafts/
5. Add **Source Folders:** research/, notes/
6. Click **Save**

## Step 4: Set a Goal (Optional)

While editing the project:
1. Enter a **Word Count Goal** (e.g., 80000)
2. Save

## Step 5: Open the Stats Panel

1. Click the Lighthouse ribbon icon, or
2. Run **Lighthouse: Toggle Stats Panel**

You should now see your project statistics!

## Step 6: Start Writing

Open a file in your `chapters/` folder and start writing. Watch the word counts update in real-time.
